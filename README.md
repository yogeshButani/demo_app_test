Was unable to integrate api because on postman it was not working at that time, so all the data inside the test are totally static.

Shared screenshot on email to HR that apis which are given in postman collection are not working.

Used here provider state management here to perform the given task.

As i can see i have done all the mentioned task in the doc, except API integration.

All the data you are seeing in the UI are static, not dynamic because API was not responding at that time so done the test with static data.

Please make a git clone of the project and run the app.

used here latest flutter version i.e 3.27.1 to build this test.

Also fetching data of card styles dynamically through firebase, can check code in Home screen
